Hello World!

Parker here! I'm 20 years old and a student at Wake Technical Community College, studying computer programming. I'm planning on transferring to Campbell next fall to continue my education. I've only ever used Git for looking at code, and other examples of it, but never in this capacity. I'm excited to use it, it seems interesting.
